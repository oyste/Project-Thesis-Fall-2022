# Specialization-Project-Fall-2022
 This repo contains code made for my specialization project fall 2022. 

The main code framework used for preprocessing, feature extraction, cross validation and classification for the binary classifier I designed for PhysioNet CinC 2016 challenge dataset can be found in **\binary classifier**.

The repo also contains files regarding a artihmetic test made to be taken during a mental stress trial which displays arithmetic problems and sends markers over Lab Streaming Layer. This code can be found in **\dataset collection**.
